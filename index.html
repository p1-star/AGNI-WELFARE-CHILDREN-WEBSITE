      <h2>About Organization</h2><br></br>
      <p class="left">
        <strong>AGNI RURAL WELFARE SOCIETY</strong>, a society of Social work organization.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        We beg to introduce ourselves as a non-government and non-profit organization working intensively in the semi
        urban region of South 24 Parganas District of West Bengal. Our operational area is presently at Sonarpur Block
        but ready to extend little broader region in the entire Baruipur sub division.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        This is for your kind inform that we started from the very beginning two day’s weekly Training Programme at
        Sonarpur Mahavidyalaya play ground "Drill, Band, Physical training, sports, games, Obstacle Management, Disaster
        Management, Civil Defence, NDA, IMA, OTA (Army, Navy, Air Force) examination & inspiration training". Our
        primary aim is to cover the students belonging to Secondary & Higher Secondary schools within the jurisdiction
        of Baruipur SDO & by the help of this programme the students will be highly benefited in all respects.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        We have much pleasure to inform you that we are started National Defense Academy Inspiration training (Army,
        Navy & Air Force) UPSC examination preparation for school students at jurisdiction of Baruipur SDO. There are
        many students who are not aware in this area about the Examination as per Indian army survey report. We, the
        only organization have taken necessary measures to educate the students for preparation of National Defense
        Academy (Army, Navy & Air Force) & UPSC examination for their bright career.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        Established on 22/09/2008. We started the process of getting some of the poor kids to be impaired for
        brightening their aim. In 2009, there was a storm Aila in the south of the south 24 Parganas. Many people of the
        Sundarbans, after losing another, clothes, water, water and habitat. To cope with this situation and to keep
        them in mind, we and our organization's students collect relief materials from the area and deliver relief
        material to the people of these flooded areas. Storm like Aila teaches many things in our lives. We then plan
        that there is a need to tackle the crisis of emergency in all areas.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        Students, young people are troubled by many anti-social and cultural issues, and they are becoming addicted to
        various forms and their education teachers and humanitarianism are being overthrown by the teachers and honor of
        the elders. Due to the nonconformity, social norms among them are being lost day by day. They are becoming
        physically and mentally weak, keeping them healthy and physically fit in the environment and making them reflect
        in society through training.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        We did a survey in South 24 Parganas, which showed that some poor children are losing their parents' negligence.
        They do not have any desire and plans like their future. Parents of these families can not give them the right
        time, and many of them are nutritious A lack is seen In the absence of suitable food they are lagging behind
        mental and physical development.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        In view of this, a special purpose was taken from our organization that a training camp was organized to tackle
        one of the worst disaster situations for one and a half students in the sports premises of Sonarpur College in
        front of Sonarpur BDO. We train students to collect some of them from the society, where the “Drill, Obstacle,
        Pipe Band, Games, Self Defense, P.T, Disaster Management, sea explorer, Yoga, Telent hunt, Civil defense,
        Grooming & Inspiration of join NDA, IMA, OTA (Indian Army, Navy, Air Force) examination etc” Give training
        Creating a goal among them that they will be in the future.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        These students and their parents can not send them any day or outside as they are not able to do so. We take
        them to camp for 10 days each year on school holidays every day, so that their old-minded reading is not wasted,
        time is spent on training and singing about their hills or the ocean areas.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        One of our little efforts is to make them healthy, strong, emotionally, physically, and socially trained by
        them. By introducing them to various welfare social services and spreading their socialism.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left"><strong>We are working with various type of social welfare activities, such as:</strong><br></br>

      <p class="left">
        In this era, the youth and the student community are being overwhelmed by a superstitious, uneasy condition. By
        establishing them in a healthy society through such a program, we have a small effort.
        <br></br>
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        We are thinking of the academy in the future for an NDA where the students will be in a healthy entry and they
        will have the right to be trained in education and various remedies where they can have a healthy society.
        <br></br>

      <h3>Dear Cadets, <br></br></h3>
      <p class="left">
        We beg to introduce ourselves as a non-governmental and non-profit organization working extensively in the
        semi-urban and rural regions of West Bengal. At present, our operational area is the Sonarpur Block; however, we
        are prepared to expand our activities across the entire state. Since Cyclone Aila in 2009 and the subsequent
        devastation in the Sundarbans, we have been actively involved in social welfare activities in districts such as
        South 24 Parganas, Midnapore, Darjeeling, and Kalimpong.<br></br>
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        We are pleased to inform you that we conduct regular training camps every Saturday and Sunday, covering
        activities such as Drill, Physical Training, Marching Band, Obstacle Management, Sports and Games, Cultural
        Activities, Yoga, Wrestling, Disaster Management, Motivation and Personality Grooming, Screening, and Awareness
        Training for NDA, IMA, and OTA (Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force) examinations. These camps are held at Sonarpur
        Mahavidyalaya Playground and Rajpur Agami Playground from 6:20 AM to 10:30 AM.<br></br>
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Several schools have approached us requesting support in conducting such training programs at their
        institutions, as most schools lack qualified teachers or trainers for these activities. In response, some
        schools have formally requested us to provide trainers, at least for drill training.<br></br>
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        To meet this growing demand, we are planning to launch a six-month paid internship programme in which we intend
        to engage NCC ‘C’ Certificate holder cadets who can provide training in one school per week. During the
